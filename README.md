# TODO

- determind amount of players as opposed to a 4 player hardcode
- create HashMap<HashSet<String>, Item> where the key is a set of the words in name of the item, then use that hashmaps keys to find the corrosponding item with the power of set intersections, this way we remove possible junk words
- retry in a few milisecs if we fail
